    <h3>About the Piece</h3>

    <p>
        The theme of the piece is nostalgia. I go back in time through music and end at the music I heard when <br>
        I was a kid because my parents played it. I then work my way to that point by passing through music <br>
        that had an immense impact on me as I was growing up. This project was especially meaningful since I'm <br> 
        graduating and can't help but look back. The albums highlighted are, <i>Take Care</i> by Drake, <br>
        <i>good kid, m.A.A.d city</i> by Kendrick Lamar, <i>2014 Forest Hills Drive</i> by J Cole, and <i>The Barbra Streisand Album</i> <br>
        by Barbra Streisand.

        The Music Time Machine functions as follows: The joystick poking out of the top of the enclosure acts as a fast forward <br>
        mechanism, which moves the user further into the past from the present. Flicking the joystick to the left will play a song that <br>
        was released before than the previous one. Within the enclosure, the joystick is connected to a breadboard configured the same <br>
        way it was for joystick lab we did in class. Since I am only using the x-axis however, to move backwards through time, I only <br>
        attached the x-sensor to pin 13 on my ESP32, as well as ground and power of course.

        I made several design choices to best portray my appreciation for these pieces. For one, the enclosure is made <br>
        entirely of the vinyl cases of these albums. This proved to be a good amount of work because of the height of the <br>
        cases. I ended up stacking some textbooks on top of each other so that breadboard and joystick would be tall enough <br>
        to poke through the in the case. I also used the back of the Barba Streisand album to be the lid of the enclosure <br>
        because frankly, it was a dollar and was the only one it didn't hurt too much to cut a hole in. I chose the back <br> 
        because it was quite disturbing to see Barb's face with a hole in it. Moreover, I chose to start with the more <br>
        recent songs and work my way backwards as opposed to the other way around because I wanted nostalgia to increase <br>
        as the user moved through the experience. I also took the pictures in my emptied room to further accentuate the <br>
        feeling of nostalgia, the vinyls that made my enclosure were once on the now empty wall behind it. <br>

    <h3>Setup</h3>
    <p>
        Creating the exhibit requires a couple of steps. The first is to download the Arduino software, in my case, <br>
        I needed to download the Legacy version, an older version of the software. Once it is downloaded and running, <br>
        go to file->preferences and then enable the esp32 board by inserting this url where it says additional boards manager: <br>
        <a href="https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json">https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json</a><br>
        <br>
        Then go to Tools->Boards->ESP32 Arduino and select TTGO T1. In order to select a port, make sure that the ESP32 <br>
        is connected to the your machine using a data transfer USB-C cable. In my case, I needed to download <a href="http://www.wch.cn/downloads/CH34XSER_MAC_ZIP.html">this driver</a> <br>
        and reset my machine in order to get the code to load on my ESP32. <br>
        <br>
        For those that also need to download the driver, select the port /dev/cu.wchusbserial.<br>
        <br>

        It is also required to install the TFT_eSPI library by Bodmer. This can be done by going to Tools->Library Manager. <br>
        <br>

        All of files required to recreate experience (listed below) can be found in this <a href="https://github.com/Alejandro0208/Module2">Git Repository</a> <br>
        
        "music.js" 
        "index.html"
        "joystick.ino"

        joystick.ino was sourced directly from "Freenove Ultimate Starter Kit For ESP32" <br>
        <br>
        music.js was heavily sourced from http://www.marksantolucito.com/COMS3430/fall2022/delay/ <br>
        and http://www.marksantolucito.com/COMS3430/fall2022/3dpanning which were recommended to me <br>
        by fellow classmate Nicholas Denton-Cheng. I also referenced some of Nick's code for his <br>
        Module 2 (with his permission of course) when I realized we had similar project ideas.
